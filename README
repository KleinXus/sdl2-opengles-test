SDL2 OpenGL ES Test Applications
================================

These two applications test touch input and OpenGL ES context creation
of SDL 2.0 when using in combination with the Wayland video driver.

Prerequisites:

 - SDL 2.0 with Wayland support built in ../SDL/build/ with source in ../SDL/
   (or modify makefile to point to different source/build directory)

How to build:

    make

For convenience during development, this does run "make" for SDL2 as well
to make sure that the libSDL2 we are building against is up to date.
